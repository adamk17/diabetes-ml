# 🩺 diabetes-ml

A complete machine learning pipeline for predicting diabetes progression using FastAPI, TensorFlow (Keras), PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS (S3 + RDS), and Terraform.

This project showcases how to train a regression model, serve it as an API, and deploy it with cloud infrastructure – all production-ready and containerized.
